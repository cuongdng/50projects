                <h1>My Favorite Books of 2021</h1>
                <small> December 28, 2021 | Filed In: books, lifestyle</small>
                <p>
                    “The longer you put something off, the harder it is get
                    done” was basically the story of my life in 2021. From job
                    hunting to blog posts, I was great at putting things in my
                    personal life on the back burner until the last minute.
                    Especially when it came to my blog series. I love sharing
                    the books I’ve read, but once I missed September 2021, it
                    became harder and harder to catch up. It didn’t help that
                    while my reading was slow at the beginning of the year and
                    then SPED up towards the end. At this point, going back and
                    trying to do all the books I read August to December seems
                    like too high of a hill to climb (especially since I’m close
                    to 140). So I decided that I would share my favorite books
                    of 2021 instead. If you want to see the full reading list,
                    check out my Goodreads or my instagram where I’m working on
                    catching up (it’s much easier to do a star rating there now
                    and I have a highlight where I save all of the lists). < /p>
                </p>
                <h3>MYSTERY</h3>

                    A mystery meets comedy with a little romance thrown in.
                    Honestly, it’s like they wrote this book just for me. A for
                    Aunties is about a family run wedding business and what
                    happens when a bad date produces a dead man and that body
                    just keeps reappearing during one of the biggest weddings of
                    the year. The sequel comes out in 2022 and I can’t wait to
                    read it.
